# media

A place to store images, audio files, video files, docs, slide decks, and other media files or blobs to be included in wiki or REAME docs.

To include an image in a github wiki page, it has to be available as a URL.

Don't want to clutter up code repositories with commits that merely add media files to include
in a wiki page.
